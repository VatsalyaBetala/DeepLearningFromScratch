# Deep Learning Notebook

This a purposeful change, just for the purpose of testing
This repository contains two comprehensive Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of deep learning. Perfect for beginners and intermediate learners, these notebooks cover everything from perceptrons to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and demonstrate the implementation using TensorFlow's Keras.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `Deep_Learning_Journey.ipynb`
This notebook is divided into several sections, each dedicated to a different aspect of neural network implementation from the foundational level

#### Sections
1. **Implementing Perceptron from Scratch**
   - Introduction to neural computation with a basic perceptron for binary classification.
   
2. **Artificial Neural Network - Multi Layer Perceptron**
   - Builds on the perceptron by introducing hidden layers and backpropagation, implemented from scratch.

3. **Using TensorFlow and Keras**
   - Demonstrates the use of high-level APIs from TensorFlow's Keras to implement MLPs efficiently.

### 2. `Vatsalya_CNN_Padding_Strides_Pooling.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), explaining the concepts of padding, strides, and pooling. It includes practical implementations and visualizations.

#### Sections
1. **CNN with 'Valid' Padding**
   - Demonstrates how to build a basic CNN model with 'valid' padding.
   
2. **CNN with 'Same' Padding**
   - Shows the implementation of a CNN model with 'same' padding.

3. **CNN with Strides**
   - Explains how to use strides in CNN layers for downsampling.

4. **Adding Pooling Layers**
   - Illustrates the use of MaxPooling layers in CNNs for downsampling and reducing spatial dimensions.

5. **LeNet-5 Architecture**
   - A complete implementation of the classic LeNet-5 architecture for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.
