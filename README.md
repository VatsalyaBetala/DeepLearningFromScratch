# Deep Learning Notebook

This single Jupyter notebook encompasses a full journey through the fundamentals of neural networks, from the basics of perceptrons to more advanced multi-layer perceptrons, culminating in the use of TensorFlow's Keras for efficient implementations. This comprehensive guide is perfect for those beginning their exploration into the world of deep learning.

## Notebook Overview
`Deep_Learning_Journey.ipynb`: This notebook is divided into several sections, each dedicated to a different aspect of neural network implementation.

### Sections
1. **Implementing Perceptron from Scratch**
   - Introduction to neural computation with a basic perceptron for binary classification.
   
2. **Artificial Neural Network - Multi Layer Perceptron**
   - Builds on the perceptron by introducing hidden layers and backpropagation, implemented from scratch.

3. **Using TensorFlow and Keras**
   - Demonstrates the use of high-level APIs from TensorFlow's Keras to implement MLPs efficiently.
